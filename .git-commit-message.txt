refactor: Architecture clarification and 8-year data expansion

MAJOR CHANGES:
- Two-database MongoDB architecture (fec_bulk + legal_tender)
- Streaming parsers with dynamic batch sizing (memory-safe for 2-4GB files)
- Expanded from 2 years → 8 years of FEC data (2020-2026)
- Added individual contributions & independent expenditures assets
- Comprehensive documentation in README & MONGODB_STRUCTURE

BUSINESS LOGIC CLARIFICATION:
- Focus: Corporate/PAC influence tracking (NOT individual donors)
- New: Leadership PAC upstream influence tracking (money laundering detection)
- New: "Virtual PAC" concept (compare Individual $ vs Corporate PAC $)
- New: Lobbying data integration plan (Senate LDA API)

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:
- Memory-safe streaming for large files (never load 4GB into RAM)
- Dynamic batch sizing based on available memory (1K-100K records)
- Two-database architecture (raw fec_bulk, processed legal_tender)
- Added psutil for memory detection

FILES CHANGED:
- README.md: 300 → 900+ lines (comprehensive documentation)
- MONGODB_STRUCTURE.md: Complete rewrite with schemas
- src/assets/individual_contributions.py: NEW streaming parser
- src/assets/independent_expenditures.py: NEW with negative values for opposition
- src/utils/memory.py: NEW dynamic batch sizing
- src/resources/mongo.py: Added database override parameter
- requirements.txt: Added psutil

NEXT STEPS (for tomorrow):
1. Review schemas in MONGODB_STRUCTURE.md
2. Build proper flows for donor aggregation
3. Implement Leadership PAC upstream tracking (pas2 files)
4. Add lobbying data integration (Senate LDA API)
5. Everything until AI implementation (Phase 1-3)

This refactor clarifies WHAT we're building (corporate influence tracking)
and HOW we're building it (streaming, two-database, memory-safe).
